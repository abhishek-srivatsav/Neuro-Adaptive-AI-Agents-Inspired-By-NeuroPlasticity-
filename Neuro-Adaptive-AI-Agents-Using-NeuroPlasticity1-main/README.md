# 🧠 Neuro-Adaptive Multi-Agent System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Neuro-Adaptive Multi-Agent System** is an advanced AI framework inspired by **human neuroplasticity**. It simulates how humans adapt when one sensory capability is limited by introducing specialized AI agents that compensate for missing modalities.

The system integrates multiple data modalities:

- 📝 Text
- 🔊 Audio
- 🖼️ Image

and dynamically routes reasoning through **Normal**, **Blind**, **Mute**, and **LessHearable** agents.

### Applications

- Assistive AI Systems
- Inclusive Human–AI Interaction
- Cognitive Intelligence Research
- Multimodal Reasoning Visualization
- Neuro-Adaptive Artificial Intelligence

## 🧠 Neuroplasticity-Inspired Design

The system is inspired by the way the human brain adapts when one sensory channel becomes unavailable.

### Agent Adaptation Model

| Condition | Compensation Mechanism |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Blindness | Audio + Text |
| Muteness | Image + Text |
| Hearing Impairment | Memory Summarization |
| Normal Perception | All Modalities |

Specialized agents collaborate, exchange feedback, and store compact memories to improve future reasoning and decision-making.

## 🤖 Agents in the System

| Agent | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NormalPersonAgent** | Full multimodal reasoning using image, audio, and text |
| **BlindPersonAgent** | Audio and text-based reasoning without visual input |
| **MutePersonAgent** | Image and text-based reasoning without audio input |
| **LessHearableAgent** | Memory-enhanced reasoning and hearing compensation |

> **Note:** LessHearableAgent operates internally and cannot be directly selected by users.
